## 💡 About the 42 Discovery Piscine

The **Discovery Piscine** is an introductory program offered by **42 Porto**. It serves as a "first dive" into the world of coding and the unique 42 methodology. Over a shorter period than the main Piscine, participants explore the fundamentals of web development and logical thinking.

* **Peer-to-Peer Learning:** Even in the Discovery phase, the focus is on collaborating with peers and finding solutions without traditional teachers.
* **Tech Stack:** Primarily focused on **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, providing the tools to build first web applications.

## 📚 Study Repository: Discovery Journey

This repository contains the projects and exercises I completed during the 42 Porto Discovery Piscine.

### 🎯 Objective of this Repository

The main goal of this repository is to **centralize and document** my initial learning curve:

* **Organization:** A structured space for my first web projects and logic exercises.
* **Progress Tracking:** To see how my understanding of web technologies evolved day by day.
* **Foundation:** To serve as a base for future projects as I continue my journey in technology.

### 📁 Structure

The modules are organized by daily challenges and specific topics:

| Module | Topic | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Day 01` | HTML Fundamentals | Structure, tags, and semantic web. |
| `Day 02` | CSS Basics | Styling, colors, and layout positioning. |
| `Day 03` | Responsive Web | Flexbox, Grid, and mobile-first design. |
| `Day 04` | Intro to JS | Variables, functions, and DOM manipulation. |
| `Rush` | Web Application | A complete project integrating all learned skills. |

### ⚠️ Important Note

If you are a future Discovery Piscine participant: **DO NOT COPY.** The 42 methodology is about the "struggle" and the "aha!" moment of figuring it out yourself. Copying code will rob you of the most important part of the experience: the learning process itself. **Dive in, ask your peers, and enjoy the discovery!**
